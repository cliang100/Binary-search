# Binary Search Demonstration

Welcome to the Binary Search Demonstration! This Python script (`binary_search.py`) showcases the implementation and efficiency of the binary search algorithm compared to a "naive search" approach.

## Overview

The script demonstrates two search functions:

1. **Binary Search:**
   - The `binary_search` function showcases the binary search algorithm, which efficiently finds a target element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

2. **Naive Search:**
   - The `naive_search` function provides a simple and straightforward search approach by iterating through every element in an unsorted list until the target is found.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder containing `binary_search.py`.
   - Run the script by executing the command:
     ```
     python binary_search.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use:
     ```
     python3 binary_search.py
     ```

2. **Observe Search Demonstrations:**
   - The script will showcase the binary search and naive search functions with example lists and target values.
   - It will display the search times for each function, demonstrating the efficiency of binary search for large datasets.

3. **Modify and Explore:**
   - Feel free to modify the example lists and target values in the script to explore how search times change based on the input data.

## Files

- **`binary_search.py`**: This file contains the binary search and naive search functions, along with example usage and search time demonstrations.

## Notes

- Binary search is especially effective for large, sorted datasets, providing a significant efficiency improvement over naive search algorithms.

- The script calculates and displays the time taken for each search, allowing you to compare the performance of binary search and naive search.

- If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
